# SNHU-CS210
### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was created to take user input and output a compound interest investment table. 

### What did you do particularly well?
I think I tend to do well in the organization of code and use of whitespace. 

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my use of inline comments. Sometimes I forget to use them even though they could be incredibly helpful.
 
### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
At first I struggled with outputting a neat looking display. I got help from a couple of tutors from Academic Support. I also joined the Discord server for SNHU CS students and I have made some connections there that I can use to reach out for help.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This was the first project that used multiple files, including headers. Learning how to make the various files work in Visual Studio will be very useful in the future. 

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By making good use of whitespace and sticking to coding best practices and standard naming conventions.
